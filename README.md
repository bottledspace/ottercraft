Configuration
-------------

To configure the rate of spawn, and the biomes in which otters can spawn, modify the configuration file found in `config/ottercraft.json` for all versions of Fabric, and `config/ottercraft-common.toml` for Forge 1.18.x. Forge 1.19.x uses per-world configuration instead, through the use of datapacks.


Special Thanks
